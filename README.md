# Food Recommendation System

## Introduction: 
The Food Recommendation Application is a mobile application that provides food recommendations to users based on their preferences. This application is developed using the Flutter framework and is a machine learning project that uses the TfidfVectorizer method for analyzing and classifying user input data to provide relevant recommendations. The application aims to simplify the process of finding suitable food items for users who may have dietary restrictions or preferences.

## Project Description: 

The food recommendation application is designed to offer an intuitive interface that is easy to navigate. Users are required to input their dietary preferences, including their preferred cuisine, diet type, and preferred flavour. The application uses the TfidfVectorizer method to analyze the user's input data and extract relevant features that are used to suggest food items that align with their preferences. The TfidfVectorizer method is a popular technique used in natural language processing for converting textual data into numerical features that can be used in machine learning algorithms.
The application uses a machine learning model that is trained on a dataset of food items and their attributes. The model is trained to analyze the user's input data and provide recommendations based on the user's preferences. 


## Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Food Recommendation Application is a machine learning project that uses the TfidfVectorizer method to provide accurate food recommendations to users. The application is developed using Flutter, making it accessible to users on both Android and iOS platforms.
